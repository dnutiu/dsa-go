# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository is my self study guide for data structures and algorithms. I implement them from scratch in Go
and then write unit test for them.

What better way to learn a language and new concepts exists other than practicing them.

## Data Structures

* Hash
  Set [Implementation](https://github.com/dnutiu/dsa-go/blob/master/hash_set/hash_set/hash_set.go) | [Tests](https://github.com/dnutiu/dsa-go/blob/master/hash_set/hash_set/hash_set_test.go)

### Other

I also maintain a DSA repo for Java & Kotlin, which you can find [here](https://github.com/dnutiu/dsa)
